## Reporting a Bug

fixed your bug.

this bug already.

# Pull Requests

We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide:

1. Fork the repo.

2. Run the tests. We only take pull requests with passing tests(`grunt test`)

3. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes
require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, we need
a test!

4. Make the test pass.

5. Commit your changes. If your pull request fixes an issue specify it in the commit message.
Here's an example: `git commit -m "Close #51 â€“ add style to events"`

6. Push to your fork and submit a pull request. Please provide us with some
explanation of why you made the changes you made. For new features make sure to
explain a standard use case to us.
